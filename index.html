               <h2>St. Louis, Missouri</h2>
               <p>Alright, I'm starting with the "boring" one. The first location on my list of places that I have visited is St. Louis, Missouri. Since being founded in February of 1764, St. Louis has grown to a population of over 300,000. In addition this population, St. Louis is frequently visted not only by people from the surrounding areas, but from people all over the world. Throughout St. Louis, there are many attractions to visit. There's the City Museum, the St. Louis Art Museum, the St. Louis Zoo, and many more.</p>

               <h2>Cape Girardeau, Missouri</h2>
               <p>The next location is near and dear to my heart. Cape Girardeau, Missouri is home to roughly 39,000 people. The main thing that is notable about Cape Girardeau is Southeast Missouri State University. Boasting a total enrollment of approximately 12,000 students and Division 1 athletics, SEMO is place that I chose to attend for my college education.</p>

               <h2>Daytona, Florida</h2>
               <p>Daytona, Florida was one of my first vacations that were not in Illinois or Missouri. With a population near 75,000 people, Daytona also features a large amount of beach acces as it's main attraction. This was the first place that I was able to see the ocean in person. I traveled here in high school with my parents for a family vacation.</p>

               <h2>Auburn, Maine</h2>
               <p>Last year, I traveled to Auburn, Maine in order to visit a close friend from college. While Auburn itself does not have many attractions itself, it is located moderately close to several attractions. My favorite attraction that I was able to visit was the lighthouse in Portland.</p>

               <h2>Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia</h2>
               <p>Growing up, I was fortunate enough to participate in my local Boy Scouts of America Troop. I learned many skills from this and had many opportunities that I would not otherwise have had. One of those was attenfing the National Jamboree in 2010 at Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia. This hjamboree was spcial as it was the 100 year anniversary of the organization being founded. The jamboree serves as a gathering for boyu scouts all across the nation to particpate in various activities.</p>

               <h2>Chicago, Illinois</h2>
               <p>While I was in middle school, I had the opportunity to visit Chicago, Illinois. With a population of more than 2.5 million people, there are always many things happening in the area. THere are also numerous tourist attractions, such as Navy Pier, the Art Institute of Chicago, and Millenium Park.</p>

               <h2>East Lansing, Michigan</h2>
               <p>My vist to East Lansing, Michigan was also for a boy scout event. This time, it was for NOAC, the National Order of the Arrow Conference. It is similar to the jamboree above, but this was for a specific group of scouts within the Boy Scouts of America, the Order of the Arrow. This was a group of scouts who were looking to be more involved in the organization and in there communities than what the average scout wanted.</p>

               <h2>Richmond, Virginia</h2>
               <p>My visit to Richmond was especially interesting to me as it was the first time that I traveled a long distance alone. My reason for visiting Richmond was for a Magic: the Gathering tournament. I qualified for it because I had a local store that I was playing at often enough that I had earned enough Planeswalker Points to attend. I definitely did not do well, which is what I expected, but I enjoyed the experience. My main drive behind attending the tournament is that I did not know if I would ever qualify again.</p>

               <h2>Cabo San Lucas, Mexico</h2>
               <p>This past summer, I took my first "out-of-country" vacation to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. I took this vacation with my now wife and several of her friends. It was an all-inclusive resort and I would not have done it any other way. Being all-inclusive, I did not have to worry about groceries or bringing my own money. If I do another vacation outside of the country, I will definitely do all-inclusive if possible.</p>
